    <h1>About Capstone</h1>
    <p>We believe that language is beautiful and malleable(mostly). As new technology and new generations come along, they create their own ways to communicate. We think it is very important to preserve the foundations of communication while still keeping up with the rapidity of modern times. So we built this resource to help the world document it's many uses of language and styles of communicating</p> 

    <p>Because saying "Back in my day..." should no longer be followed by a condescending comment. It should be followed up with a story, some history and context. Today is still your day. Don't stay in the past, stay relevant!</p>

    <p>This is the place to redefine words, hence the name. But it is also a valuable resource for anyone to learn and improve our communication skills.</p>

    <p>We don't want you to just redefine words. We want to see you redefine phrases, provide context, examples (videos, images, and/or audio) for words you already know, teach us and other users new or up and coming slang words the kids use nowadays, and talk to the community!</p>
    
    <p>Professionals, students, parents, aunts, uncles, teachers, professors, intellectuals, kids and elderly are all welcome here. This is as much a learning platform as it is a language search engine that provides official documentation along with crowd-sourced data and more!</p>
